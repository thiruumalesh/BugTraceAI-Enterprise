  Agent specialized in issue resolution, refactoring, and feature extension for the
  BugTraceAI-CLI backend: FastAPI REST API, scan pipeline, vulnerability agents, and
  automated offensive security tooling.
---

## Project context

- Stack: Python 3.10+, FastAPI, Typer, SQLite/SQLModel/Alembic, LanceDB, Loguru, Pydantic v2.
- REST API lives in `bugtrace/api/` (port 8000). CLI entry point is `bugtrace/__main__.py` (Typer + Rich).
- Async-first architecture: all scan logic, HTTP calls, and DB access must be asynchronous.
- Each vulnerability class has its own agent under `bugtrace/agents/<vuln>/`.
- The scan pipeline is orchestrated by `bugtrace/core/pipeline.py` and `conductor.py`.
- All configuration goes in `bugtraceaicli.conf` and `.env`. No hardcoded values in source code.

## Code style

- Mirror the existing codebase style. Do not introduce unrelated style changes.
- Formatter: Black with `line-length = 120`; imports: isort with `profile = "black"`.
- Add type hints to every new or modified function. mypy runs with `ignore_missing_imports = true`.
- Naming: `snake_case` for modules, functions, and variables; `PascalCase` for classes and Pydantic models.
- Use **Loguru** exclusively for logging (`from loguru import logger`). Never use `print()`.
- Do not add external dependencies unless strictly required and explicitly justified.

## Architecture and patterns

- **Async first**: use `async/await` in every function that touches I/O (DB, HTTP, filesystem).
  Never call blocking functions inside async contexts; wrap them with `asyncio.to_thread()` if needed.
- **New vulnerability agent**: create under `bugtrace/agents/<vuln>/<vuln>_agent.py` implementing
  the `BaseAgent` interface, then register it in `bugtrace/core/conductor.py`.
- **Database**: SQLite is the source of truth. Every schema change requires an Alembic migration
  (`alembic revision --autogenerate`). Never run raw DDL.
- **Schemas**: request/response models go in `bugtrace/schemas/`. Use Pydantic v2 with explicit
  validators; never expose ORM models directly in route handlers.
- **External HTTP**: use `httpx.AsyncClient` with explicit timeouts. Do not instantiate the client
  at module scope; inject it or create it with a context manager.
- **Event bus**: propagate scan events through `bugtrace/core/event_bus.py`.
  Do not couple agents directly to each other.

## Issue resolution

- Identify and fix the root cause, not the symptom.
- Reproduce the bug with a failing test before making any code change.
- If the fix changes a module's public API, update the corresponding docstring.
- Check whether the issue touches the WAF bypass flow (`bugtrace/tools/waf/`) or the
  false-positive validator (`core/validator_engine.py`) before assuming it is isolated.

## Testing

- Framework: `pytest` with `asyncio_mode = "auto"` and `pytest-cov`.
- Every bug fix must include a regression test. Every new feature must include unit tests and,
  if it involves real I/O, an integration test.
- Mark tests with `@pytest.mark.unit` or `@pytest.mark.integration` as appropriate.
- Tests live in `tests/` mirroring the structure of `bugtrace/`
  (e.g. `tests/agents/xss/test_xss_agent.py`).
- Mock LLM calls with `unittest.mock.AsyncMock`. Never make real calls to paid APIs in tests.
- Verify minimum coverage for the modified module with `pytest --cov=bugtrace/<module>`.

## Security

- Never hardcode credentials, API keys, or secrets in source code.
- Sanitize all user-supplied input (scan URLs, payloads) before passing it to subprocesses or SQL queries.
- Validate URLs with `pydantic.AnyHttpUrl` before starting any scan.
- Respect `core/instance_lock.py`: never start a scan without checking the instance lock first.

## Git and version control

- Stage only the files relevant to the change. Never use `git add .` or `git add -A`.
- Commit message format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, or `chore:` followed by a concise description.
- Do not include `Co-Authored-By` in commits.
- The `tests/` directory, secrets, and API keys must never be committed.

## Performance

- Identify and resolve blocking calls or N+1 queries in any code being modified.
- Use semaphores (`core/phase_semaphores.py`) to control parallelism within pipeline phases.
- Prefer streaming or chunked processing over loading full result sets into memory for large scans.
