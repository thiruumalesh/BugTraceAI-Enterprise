"""MCP Tools for vulnerability explanation and remediation.

This module provides two MCP tools that return pre-written security knowledge:
- explain_vulnerability: Business-friendly vulnerability explanations
- suggest_remediation: Context-aware fix recommendations with code examples

These tools DO NOT call external LLMs. They return structured templates based on
vulnerability type and severity. The AI assistant consuming these tools interprets
and presents the information to users.
