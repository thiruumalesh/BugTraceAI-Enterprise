Service Event Bus - Scan-scoped event history and streaming.

Wraps the existing core EventBus to add scan-scoped capabilities:
- Event history per scan_id for reconnection/replay
- Async streaming for real-time event consumption
- Automatic cleanup after scan completion

Solves INF-01 (event loop conflicts) by working with single asyncio event loop.
